Researchers use advanced models to uncover critical thresholds in global ocean circulation, highlighting potential climate impacts.
Read the paper: [Journal of Physical Oceanography 54(7)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-23-0161.1).

A team led by Johns  Hopkins researchers has developed a mathematical model that sheds light on how small but crucial differences in the way water vapor travels through the atmosphere can lead to major shifts in ocean currents, potentially signaling “tipping points” in the Earth’s climate.  

The team’s models, described in The Journal of Physical Oceanography, could enable a deeper understanding of climate dynamics and generate more accurate predictions—essential to developing strategies that can address and potentially even mitigate the impacts of climate change.
