Biography
======
Gianluca Fabiani is a PhD student in Modeling and Engineering Risk and Complexity (MERC) at Scuola Superiore Meridionale (SSM), Naples, Italy. Additionally, He have been recently a Visiting Student at the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Johns Hopkins University.
Gianluca Fabiani holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Mathematics and a Master’s Degree in Applied Mathematics from the Department of Mathematics and Applications of the University of Naples Federico II. During his Master's Degree, the direction of his studies has focused on the numerical analysis, machine learning, statistics and mathematical modeling of complex dynamical systems. He graduated with honours, conducting his MSc Thesis entitled “Learning Partial Differential Equations from Data with Machine Learning algorithms" under the supervision of Prof. Constantinos Siettos. His research interests have found a natural continuation within the PhD program in Modeling and Engineering Risk and Complexity (MERC) at the Shool of Advances Studies of Naples (SSM).
